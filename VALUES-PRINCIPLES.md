### Agile Values
1. Individuals and interactions over processes and tools:
    - People and their communication are more important than the tools and processes they use.
2. Working software over comprehensive documentation:
    - Having a functional product is more important than having extensive written documentation.
3. Customer collaboration over contract negotiation:
    - Working closely with customers to meet their needs is more important than sticking rigidly to a contract.
4. Responding to change over following a plan:
    - Being flexible and adaptable to changes is more important than strictly following a pre-made plan.

### Agile Principles
1. Customer satisfaction through early and continuous delivery
    - **Example**: An edutech company releases a minimum viable product (MVP) of an online learning platform with essential features like video lectures and quizzes within a few weeks. This allows students and educators to start using the platform early and provide feedback for continuous improvement.

2. Welcome changing requirements, even late in development
    - **Example**: Midway through developing a math learning app, feedback reveals that students need more interactive exercises. The development team adapts by adding new features for interactive exercises even though this requirement was not in the original plan.

3. Deliver working software frequently
    - **Example**: The team delivers new features such as a progress tracking dashboard and new types of quizzes every two weeks, ensuring that the platform continuously evolves and improves.

4. Business people and developers must work together daily
    - **Example**: Daily stand-up meetings include both the product owner (representing the business) and the development team to ensure alignment on goals, priorities, and any changes needed based on market feedback.

5. Build projects around motivated individuals
    - **Example**: The company hires passionate educators and developers, giving them the autonomy to make decisions about the educational content and technological implementation. They are trusted to innovate and improve the product.

6. Face-to-face conversation is the best form of communication
    - **Example**: Regular face-to-face meetings, either in person or via video calls, between developers and educators help to quickly resolve misunderstandings about how a new feature should function.

7. Working software is the primary measure of progress
    - **Example**: Progress is measured by the number of functional and tested features available to users, such as a fully operational new module for science quizzes, rather than by the completion of documentation or milestones.

8. Sustainable development, able to maintain a constant pace
    - **Example**: The development team sets a sustainable pace by avoiding overtime and ensuring that workloads are manageable, enabling them to maintain productivity and morale over the long term.

9. Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design
    - **Example**: Regular code reviews and refactoring sessions ensure that the codebase remains clean and maintainable, and the user interface design is continually refined based on user feedback.

10. Simplicity—the art of maximizing the amount of work not done—is essential
    - **Example**: The team focuses on developing the core functionalities that provide the most value, such as key learning modules, and avoids adding unnecessary features that do not contribute directly to the learning experience.

11. Self-organizing teams produce the best architectures, requirements, and designs
    - **Example**: The development team self-organizes to decide the best technological stack and design patterns for the learning platform, leveraging their collective expertise to make informed decisions without micromanagement.

12. Regular reflection and adjustment to improve effectiveness
    - **Example**: At the end of each sprint, the team conducts a retrospective meeting to discuss what went well, what could be improved, and how to implement changes in the next sprint. For instance, they might decide to improve their testing process based on feedback from the last iteration.

By adhering to Agile values and principles, companies can create a dynamic, responsive, and user-focused product that evolves based on continuous feedback and changing requirements.
