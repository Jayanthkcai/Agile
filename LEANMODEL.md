The Lean model is a methodology focused on maximizing value while minimizing waste in the production process. It originated from Toyota's manufacturing practices but has since been adapted and applied across various industries, including software development, healthcare, and education. 

### Principles of Lean
- Value: Identify what customers truly value in a product or service.
- Value Stream: Map out the entire process of delivering value to the customer and eliminate any steps that do not add value.
- Flow: Ensure that work flows smoothly and continuously without interruptions or delays.
- Pull: Let customer demand pull products or services through the production process, minimizing overproduction.
- Perfection: Continuously strive for perfection by eliminating waste and improving processes.

**Example**
- **Scenario**: An edutech startup is developing a new mobile app to help students improve their math skills through interactive quizzes.

    - **Value**: The startup identifies that what students truly value is an engaging and personalized learning experience that helps them understand and practice math concepts effectively.

    - **Value Stream**: They map out the entire process of developing the app, from designing user interfaces to coding backend functionalities and testing the app. They identify steps like lengthy documentation reviews that do not directly contribute to the app's value and streamline or eliminate them.

    - **Flow**: The development team organizes their work in small, cross-functional teams, allowing for continuous integration and delivery. They use agile methodologies like Scrum or Kanban to ensure that work flows smoothly without bottlenecks.

    - **Pull**: Instead of developing features based on assumptions, the startup regularly gathers feedback from beta testers and users to understand their needs and preferences. They use this feedback to prioritize features and only work on what is necessary, minimizing overproduction.

    - **Perfection**: The team regularly conducts retrospectives to reflect on their processes and identify areas for improvement. They invest in automation tools to streamline repetitive tasks and improve efficiency. By continuously striving for perfection, they ensure that the app evolves to meet the changing needs of students.
