Agile is a project management and product development methodology that emphasizes flexibility, collaboration, and customer satisfaction. It is widely used in software development but is also applicable to other fields. The primary goal of Agile is to deliver small, functional parts of a product incrementally, allowing for frequent reassessment and adaptation to changing requirements.

### Agile and Waterfall are two distinct methodologies used for project management and software development. 

<table><thead><tr><th>Aspect</th><th>Agile</th><th>Waterfall</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>Project Structure</strong></td><td>Iterative and incremental; divided into small iterations (sprints)</td><td>Linear and sequential; divided into distinct phases</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Flexibility</strong></td><td>Highly flexible; welcomes changes even late in development</td><td>Inflexible; difficult to implement changes once phases are completed</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Customer Involvement</strong></td><td>Continuous involvement; regular reviews and feedback sessions</td><td>Limited involvement after the requirements phase</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Documentation</strong></td><td>Minimal and just-in-time documentation; focus on working product</td><td>Comprehensive documentation; detailed plans for each phase</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Risk Management</strong></td><td>Continuous risk identification and mitigation</td><td>Risks identified and mitigated at the beginning</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Delivery</strong></td><td>Incremental delivery; potentially shippable product increments</td><td>Final product delivered at the end of the project lifecycle</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Adaptability</strong></td><td>Responds well to changing requirements and new insights</td><td>Challenging to adapt to changes once phases are completed</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Testing</strong></td><td>Continuous testing throughout iterations</td><td>Testing phase occurs after implementation</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Planning</strong></td><td>Short-term planning; detailed for each iteration</td><td>Long-term planning; detailed upfront</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Customer Feedback</strong></td><td>Actively sought and used for product refinement</td><td>Feedback primarily at the end</td></tr></tbody></table>

### Waterfall Example: Traditional Learning Management System (LMS) Development
<table><thead><tr><th><strong>Phase</strong></th><th><strong>Description</strong></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>Requirements</strong></td><td>Gather detailed requirements from stakeholders</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Design</strong></td><td>Create complete design for LMS based on requirements</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Implementation</strong></td><td>Build LMS according to design specifications</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Verification</strong></td><td>Test entire system against requirements</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Maintenance</strong></td><td>Maintain and fix issues after delivery</td></tr></tbody></table>

Drawbacks: Difficult and costly to address misunderstood requirements; customer only sees final product.

### Agile Example: Educational Mobile App for Kids
<table><thead><tr><th><strong>Iteration</strong></th><th><strong>Activities</strong></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>Iteration 1</strong></td><td>Plan and develop basic addition game; test with children; collect feedback</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Iteration 2</strong></td><td>Refine addition game; plan and develop subtraction game; test both games; collect feedback</td></tr></tbody></table>

Benefits: Continuous feedback ensures engagement and educational value; easy to incorporate changes based on feedback.
