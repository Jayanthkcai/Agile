Agile transformation refers to the process of an organization shifting its culture, processes, and mindset to adopt Agile principles and practices. It's not just about implementing Agile methodologies in isolated teams or projects but about fundamentally changing how the entire organization operates and delivers value. 

### Componenets
1. **Culture Shift**: Agile transformation requires a cultural shift towards collaboration, adaptability, and continuous improvement. This often involves breaking down silos between departments, fostering a mindset of openness to change, and empowering teams to make decisions.

This may involve implementing frameworks like Scrum or Kanban, establishing cross-functional teams, and adopting Agile project management practices.
